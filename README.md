1. Homelessness has been and is a growing issue in LA County 

2. Overall homeless population (in and out of homelessness) is 66,000 in January 2020. 

3. Tackling homelessness begins with identifying homeless populations and encampments.

3. Currently,  identifying homeless populations and encampments is done through manual counting by LADWP volunteers in Los Angeles.

4. We are solving this problem by performing  machine learning on images to automatically detect homeless encampments and classify them.

5. Cameras will be set on the vehicles and while moving these vehicles will take images from LA streets. These images will be given to our homeless encampment detection model. The model will detect the number of encampments in images. GPS will be used to detect the location and count the number of encampments in a certain location.

6. Applied computer vision to detect homeless encampments from street images of Los Angeles.

7. Developed YOLO model and detected homeless encampments with precision 0.86 and F1-score 0.83
